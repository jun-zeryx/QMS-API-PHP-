# QMS-API-PHP-
REST API for QMS built using PHP

This API is not meant for actual deployment, due to time constraints when developing my FYP I did not develop a proper API, this API uses GET for literally everything. A proper PHP API would use a framework such as Laravel with token-based authentication, this has none of that.
